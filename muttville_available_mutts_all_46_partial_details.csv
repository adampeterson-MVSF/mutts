Geordie,,Pomeranian/chihuahua,Male,,,14,Available for hospice adoption,"It’s not often that you come across the perfect cross between a woodland creature and a teddy bear, but sometimes the stars align bringing you a beacon of pom-chi goodness like Geordie.

Geordie is fluffy and feisty and everything you could want in a fur baby, excelling at both cuddles and couch potato-ness as well as spirited jaunts around the block.  While you’ll most likely be buffeted with a constant symphony of “aww, isn’t he just the CUTEST!”  we don’t think either of you will mind.

Shamwow,,"Poodle, miniature",Male,,,,Available,"Who remembers those old infomercials that used to play all night describing different cleaning products?  Well, meet ShamWOW (you know how he said it!), Muttville’s newest 15-year-old poodle prodigy.  He’s been eagerly mapping out Muttville with an enthusiasm commensurate to Billy Mays in an infomercial, and we have no doubt that he’ll have the lay of the land immediately.  This peppy older gent has been getting along well with the other dogs, and he’s regularly requesting scratches and cuddles from the more human volunteers.  We haven’t tried it, but we’re pretty sure his super soft fur could would be even more effective at cleaning the floor than an actual Shamwow.  Not sure we’d recommend it, but it’s easy to see where he got his name!  If you are looking for a perfect purveyor of late night cleaning products (just kidding, if you’re looking for the perfect pooch for your family), come say WOW to Shamwow today!",,,https://muttville.org/images/mutts/114/6/2/114623-100022-lg.jpg
